## Assignment Overview
This assignment covers basic TensorFlow operations, including tensor creation, reshaping, and broadcasting. Additionally, loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) were computed and compared.

### Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping

1. **Create a Random Tensor of Shape (4, 6)**:
   A random tensor was created with values between 1 and 10.
   
2. **Find Rank and Shape**:
   The rank (2) and shape (4, 6) of the tensor were computed using TensorFlow functions.
   
3. **Reshape and Transpose**:
   The tensor was reshaped into `(2, 3, 4)` and transposed to `(3, 2, 4)`.

4. **Broadcast a Smaller Tensor**:
   A smaller tensor `(1, 4)` was broadcasted to match the shape of the larger tensor and added.

### Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning

1. **Define True Values and Predictions**:
   True values and model predictions were defined.

2. **Compute Losses**:
   The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) losses were computed and compared.

3. **Modify Predictions**:
   Predictions were modified, and the losses were recomputed.

4. **Plot Loss Values**:
   A bar chart was plotted to compare the MSE and CCE losses.

## How to Run the Code
1. Install TensorFlow by running `pip install tensorflow`.
2. Run the Python script to execute the tensor operations and loss functions.
